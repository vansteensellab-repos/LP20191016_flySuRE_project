# Steps

* read data per chromosome
* downsample subset of the data, using predefined subsampling vectors
* discard:
  * SNPidx=="" (removes all data not containing SNPs)
* de-convolute data if multiple SNPs are annotated in a single data-row
* normalize cDNA/iPCR counts
* combine data from different libraries into single table
* sum and scale cDNA counts over all replicates
* normalize cDNA counts (cDNA/iPCR)
* split +/- strands
* save data
